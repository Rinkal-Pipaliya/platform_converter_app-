# Platform Converter App 
Platform Converter App is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter. It allows users to manage their contacts and switch between iOS and Android themes seamlessly. The app also includes essential features like calling contacts, adding, editing, and deleting contacts. User settings, such as theme preferences, are stored locally using shared_preferences for a personalized experience across sessions.

## Features

- Add Contacts: Users can create new contacts by providing details like name, phone number, email, and optionally a profile image.
- Edit Contacts: Existing contacts can be modified with updated details.
- Delete Contacts: Users can remove any contact from their list.
- Call Contacts: Direct calling option allows users to quickly reach out to any contact in their list.
- Platform Switch: Users can toggle between iOS and Android themes to experience different UI styles.
- Persistent Theme: The app stores theme preferences in local storage (shared_preferences), ensuring that the chosen theme is retained across app restarts.
